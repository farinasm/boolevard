Tutorials
=========

This section contains interactive tutorials demonstrating how BooLEVARD can be applied to different biological and technological systems. Each notebook includes detailed explanations and example code to support hands-on learning and adaptation to your own models.

* :doc:`Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities <tutorials/Quick_Start>`   
  In this tutorial, we explore a small Boolean model designed to simulate different cybersecurity scenarios. The model consists of nodes representing key components of a cybersecurity system. The goal is to evaluate how different conditions and guidelines affect the overall security state of the system.

* :doc:`Plant Guard Cell Abscisic Acid Signaling<tutorials/Guard_Cell_Abscisic_Acid>`    
  This tutorial uses a Boolean model that represents how the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates stomatal opening in guard cells. It highlights how counting pathways with BooLEVARD can reveal important insights into the system, illustrated through differences in the intensity of stomatal closure inhibition.

* :doc:`Tumor Cell Invasion Inhibition <tutorials/Cancer_Metastasis>`   
  This tutorial uses a Boolean model representing key molecular cascades in cancer metastasis. It showcases how activatory perturbations of two tumor suppressors (p53 and p63) and microRNA-34 reduce invasiveness and increase apoptotic cell-fate decisions.

* :doc:`Processing Boolean Models from Cell Collective <tutorials/Processing_Boolean_Models_from_Cell_Collective>`   
  In this tutorial, we present a workflow for processing Boolean models available in Cell Collective using BooLEVARD.
